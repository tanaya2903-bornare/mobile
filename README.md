#### Description: 
- This was the mini project that I made for college👨🏻‍💻. 
- The goal was to make use of `Python` and data manipulation using python liabraries such as `pandas`, `numpy` and `sklearn`.
- Front-end is created in web using `HTML`,`CSS` and `JS`.
- Web Front-end is connected to `python` backend using `eel`
- EEL is `python` liabrary which allows to communicate with `JS`.
- This way we can use front-end powered by web instead of using `tkinter`
- For recommendation purpose I used `cosine similarity` in `python`
- The data is sent back to front-end using `eel`
- Data set contains about 1k entries of different Mobiles
